It was established on July 14, 1932, as a symbol of the peaceful relationship between the two nations.The park plants over 150,000 flowers each year. Main features of the garden include an 18-foot (5.5 m) floral clock display, fountains, a chime, and twin 120-foot (37 m) concrete towers straddling the border with a peace chapel at their base.</p>
