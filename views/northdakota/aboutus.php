	    <p>ORIGIN OF STATE NAME: The state was formerly the northern section of Dakota Territory; dakota is a Siouan word meaning "allies."</p>
      <p>NICKNAME: Peace Garden State; Flickertail State.</p>
      <p>CAPITAL: Bismarck.</p>
      <p>ENTERED UNION: 2 November 1889 (39th).</p>
      <p>SONG: "North Dakota Hymn;" "Flickertail March." </p>
      <p>MOTTO: Liberty and Union, Now and Forever, One and Inseparable. </p>
      <p>FLAG: The flag consists of a blue field with yellow fringes; on each side is depicted an eagle with outstretched wings, holding in one talon a sheaf of arrows, in the other an olive branch, and in his beak a banner inscribed with the words "E Pluribus Unum." Below the eagle are the words "North Dakota"; above it are 13 stars surmounted by a sunburst. </p>
      <p>OFFICIAL SEAL: In the center is an elm tree; beneath it are a sheaf of wheat, a plow, an anvil, and a bow and three arrows, and in the background a Native American chases a buffalo toward a setting sun. The depiction is surrounded by the state motto, and the words "Great Seal State of North Dakota October 1st 1889" encircle the whole. </p>

      <p>FISH: Northern pike. </p>
